## Project Patterns

### Web UI
* The Web UI uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as its build system.
* The HTML pages used by the Web UI are found in `./src_assets/common/assets/web`.
* [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-ejs) is used as a templating system for the pages
  (check `template_header.html` and `template_header_main.html`).
* The Style System is now powered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). (Bootstrap has been removed; a lightweight shim layer maps a few legacy classes like `btn` and `form-control` to Tailwind utilities for backward compatibility.)
* Icons are provided by [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) and [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org).
* The JS framework used by the more interactive pages is [Vus.js](https://vuejs.org).

#### Routing Mode (History API)

The Vue router is configured with `createWebHistory('/')` (no hash fragment). The C++ config HTTP server provides a SPA fallback (`getSpaEntry` in `src/confighttp.cpp`) that serves `index.html` for any non-API, non-static route so deep links and refreshes work. When adding a new top‑level UI path under `/`, no backend change is needed unless it conflicts with existing static prefixes (`/api`, `/assets`, `/covers`, `/images`).

#### Tailwind CSS Integration

Tailwind utilities are compiled via PostCSS. The entry stylesheet `src_assets/common/assets/web/styles/tailwind.css` includes:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

and is imported in `main.js`. The purge/content configuration lives in `tailwind.config.js`:

```
content: ['./src_assets/common/assets/web/**/*.{html,js,ts,vue}']
```

If you place Vue/HTML/TS files outside that tree, extend the glob so their class names are not purged. Tailwind `preflight` is enabled; any remaining Bootstrap-era markup should be updated to utilities. A shim layer in `styles/tailwind.css` defines legacy class aliases (`.btn`, variants, `.form-control`) to ease incremental refactors. Prefer replacing those with first-class Tailwind utilities over time. For dynamic class generation (string concatenation) add a `safelist` in `tailwind.config.js` instead of dummy elements.

#### Building

@tabs{
  @tab{CMake | ```bash
    cmake -B build -G Ninja -S . --target web-ui
    ninja -C build web-ui
    ```}
  @tab{Manual | ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```}
}

### Localization
Sunshine and related LizardByte projects are being localized into various languages.
The default language is `en` (English).

@admonition{Community | We are looking for language coordinators to help approve translations.
The goal is to have the bars above filled with green!
If you are interesting, please reach out to us on our Discord server.}

#### CrowdIn
The translations occur on [CrowdIn][crowdin-url].
Anyone is free to contribute to the localization there.

##### Translation Basics
* The brand names *LizardByte* and *Sunshine* should never be translated.
* Other brand names should never be translated. Examples include *AMD*, *Intel*, and *NVIDIA*.

##### CrowdIn Integration
How does it work?

When a change is made to Sunshine source code, a workflow generates new translation templates
that get pushed to CrowdIn automatically.

When translations are updated on CrowdIn, a push gets made to the *l10n_master* branch and a PR is made against the
*master* branch. Once the PR is merged, all updated translations are part of the project and will be included in the
next release.

#### Extraction

##### Web UI
Sunshine uses [Vue I18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev) for localizing the UI.
The following is a simple example of how to use it.

* Add the string to the `./src_assets/common/assets/web/public/assets/locale/en.json` file, in English.
  ```json
  {
   "index": {
     "welcome": "Hello, Sunshine!"
   }
  }
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The JSON keys should be sorted alphabetically. You can use [jsonabc](https://novicelab.org/jsonabc)
  > to sort the keys.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Due to the integration with Crowdin, it is important to only add strings to the *en.json* file,
  > and to not modify any other language files. After the PR is merged, the translations can take place
  > on [CrowdIn][crowdin-url]. Once the translations are complete, a PR will be made
  > to merge the translations into Sunshine.

* Use the string in the Vue component.
  ```html
  <template>
    <div>
      <p>{{ $t('index.welcome') }}</p>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

  > [!TIP]
  > More formatting examples can be found in the
  > [Vue I18n guide](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/formatting.html).

##### Web UI Localization Review
When reviewing localized Web UI pages, treat all visible user-facing copy as localizable. Hard-coded English in Vue
templates, page headers, button labels, placeholders, empty states, saving/loading states, and status labels should be
moved behind Vue I18n keys with `$t(...)`.

Prefer adding keys under the existing page or component namespace, for example `settings`, `apps`, `index`,
`resource_card`, `webrtc`, or the relevant configuration tab. Use named placeholders for dynamic values, such as
`$t('index.version', { version })`, so translators can reorder text naturally.

For normal source changes, add new strings only to `en.json` and let CrowdIn handle translated locale files. For
explicit localization review branches where translated locale files are in scope, update the target locale files at the
same time and keep terminology consistent across related UI surfaces.

For Chinese locale review:

* Preserve product, protocol, executable, and service names such as `Playnite`, `WebRTC`, `GitHub Issues`, `H.264`,
  and `LosslessScaling.exe`.
* In Simplified Chinese, use `故障排查` for troubleshooting UI and `崩溃诊断包` for crash diagnostics bundles.
* In Traditional Chinese, use `指令` for command UI, `當機診斷套件` for crash diagnostics bundles, and `記錄檔` for
  log-file UI.

##### C++

There should be minimal cases where strings need to be extracted from C++ source code; however it may be necessary in
some situations. For example the system tray icon could be localized as it is user interfacing.

* Wrap the string to be extracted in a function as shown.
  ```cpp
  #include <boost/locale.hpp>
  #include <string>

  std::string msg = boost::locale::translate("Hello world!");
  ```

> [!TIP]
> More examples can be found in the documentation for
> [boost locale](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/locale/doc/html/messages_formatting.html).

> [!WARNING]
> The below is for information only. Contributors should never include manually updated template files, or
> manually compiled language files in Pull Requests.

Strings are automatically extracted from the code to the `locale/sunshine.po` template file. The generated file is
used by CrowdIn to generate language specific template files. The file is generated using the
`.github/workflows/localize.yml` workflow and is run on any push event into the `master` branch. Jobs are only run if
any of the following paths are modified.

```yaml
- 'src/**'
```

When testing locally, it may be desirable to manually extract, initialize, update, and compile strings. Python is
required for this, along with the python dependencies in the `./pyproject.toml` file. You can install this with
the following command.

```bash
python -m pip install ".[locale]"
```

Additionally, [xgettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext) must be installed.

* Extract, initialize, and update
  ```bash
  python ./scripts/_locale.py --extract --init --update
  ```

* Compile
  ```bash
  python ./scripts/_locale.py --compile
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]

### Testing

#### Clang Format
Source code is tested against the `.clang-format` file for linting errors. The workflow file responsible for clang
format testing is `.github/workflows/cpp-clang-format-lint.yml`.

Option 1:
```bash
find ./ -iname *.cpp -o -iname *.h -iname *.m -iname *.mm | xargs clang-format -i
```

Option 2 (will modify files):
```bash
python ./scripts/update_clang_format.py
```

#### Unit Testing
Sunshine uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit testing. Google Test is included in the
repo as a submodule. The test sources are located in the `./tests` directory.

The tests need to be compiled into an executable, and then run. The tests are built using the normal build process, but
can be disabled by setting the `BUILD_TESTS` CMake option to `OFF`.

To run the tests, execute the following command.

```bash
./build/tests/test_sunshine
```

To see all available options, run the tests with the `--help` flag.

```bash
./build/tests/test_sunshine --help
```

> [!TIP]
> See the googletest [FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq.html) for more information on how to use Google Test.

We use [gcovr](https://www.gcovr.com) to generate code coverage reports,
and [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io) to analyze the reports for all PRs and commits.

Codecov will fail a PR if the total coverage is reduced too much, or if not enough of the diff is covered by tests.
In some cases, the code cannot be covered when running the tests inside of GitHub runners. For example, any test that
needs access to the GPU will not be able to run. In these cases, the coverage can be omitted by adding comments to the
code. See the [gcovr documentation](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/guide/exclusion-markers.html#exclusion-markers) for
more information.

Even if your changes cannot be covered in the CI, we still encourage you to write the tests for them. This will allow
maintainers to run the tests locally.
